# Hospital Readmission Prediction AI

**Project:** AI Development Workflow Assignment  
**Course:** PLP Academy  

## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a machine learning pipeline designed to predict patient readmission risk. It addresses the hypothetical case study of a hospital wanting to identify patients likely to return within 30 days of discharge.

The project demonstrates the **End-to-End AI Development Workflow**, including:
1.  **Data Simulation:** Generating synthetic healthcare data.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Cleaning, splitting, and scaling data.
3.  **Modeling:** Training a Random Forest Classifier.
4.  **Evaluation:** Assessing performance using Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrices.
